The first thing you'll notice about Kotlin is that there are no semicolons :)
The next thing you may notice is that it is similar to Python syntax :)
The last thing you'll notice is that there are weird ?, !, and -> symbols that you have no idea what they mean :(

Don't worry, it's simple.
Kotlin requires you to be specific when it comes to whether or not you want something to be nullable
This means no more NullPointerErrors because it is always defined :)

? means you are allowing nullable types
! mean do not allow nullable
-> is a way to define a lambda function. "Lambdas function is essentially anonymous functions that
    we can treat as values â€” we can, for example, pass them as arguments to methods, return them,
    or do any other thing we could do with a regular object." (Sachin Kumar)

    Notice that this is only called when the Activity is created. Every time an orientation change is made
    the activity will be recreated. Try changing from Portrait mode to Landscape to see what happens.
    You must implement an onResume, onPause and cache your response to save between state changes.
    This is beyond the scope of the project, but it's worth noting.

        Volley handles the actual call to your API
        (this) keyword is referring to the context of MainActivity
        (val) is how constant variables are declared in Kotlin
        (var) is how you declare mutable variables
        Types are implicit in Kotlin, but can be declare explicitly if you so wish to (the below is equivalent)
            - ex. val queue: RequestQueue! = Volley.newRequestQueue(this)
            - ie queue is of type RequestQueue!
            - hover over the variable queue and you'll get a popup with the type RequestQueue!

        Most things you can put into activity_main.xml inherit from View
